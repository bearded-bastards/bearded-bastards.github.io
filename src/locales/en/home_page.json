    "about_paragraph": "My name is Ashley Riggle. I'm a U.S. Army veteran who's spent most of his life working with firearms—using them, maintaining them, and learning how to make them better. Gunsmithing isn't a hobby for me; it's a craft I take seriously and put real time into. I believe in solid workmanship, straight talk, and doing the job right the first time. If you're here, you're probably looking for someone who treats your firearm with the same respect you do. That's what I aim to deliver.",
